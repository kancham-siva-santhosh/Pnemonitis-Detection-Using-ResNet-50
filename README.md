# Pneumonitis Detection Using ResNet-50
This project aims to detect pneumonitis in medical images using a deep learning model based on ResNet-50 architecture. Pneumonitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of lung tissue, often caused by viral or bacterial infections. Early detection of pneumonitis through medical imaging can aid in timely treatment and management.

## Model Architecture
ResNet-50 is a deep convolutional neural network known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks. It utilizes residual connections to address the vanishing gradient problem, allowing for training of very deep networks.

## Results
Detailed results of the model's performance on the test set, including confusion matrices and ROC curves if applicable, are presented. The effectiveness of the model in detecting pneumonitis is assessed and discussed.
